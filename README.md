## Hi there üëã

I hold a PhD degree from Harbin Institute of Technology, under the supervision of Prof. SUN Jinwei and Prof. ZHANG Shiping, and I am concurrently pursuing a dual-degree PhD at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, supervised by [Prof. ZHANG Xiaoge](https://xiaogezhang.com/).

My research interests revolve around signal processing, prognostics & health management (PHM), and model compression. I have published 10+ papers at the flagship journals such as TPAMI, TII, MSSP, TIM. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at jingxiao.liao[at]outlook.com.


I graduated from the School of Instrumentation Science and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) with B.S., M.Eng., and Ph.D. degrees.
